## Mercantile

Mercantile is an eCommerce "bookstore". It is intended as a demonstration of development skill, and does not in fact sell books.

Mercantile is built using Django, React and Bootstrap. Payment processing is via Stripe. Book data is retrieved 
using the Google Books and New York Times Bestseller APIs.
